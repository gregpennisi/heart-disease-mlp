This is a multilayer perceptron designed to predict
the presence of heart disease in a patient given
certain heart-related medical readings. This was
built as a term project for Professor
White's Neural Networks and Machine Learning course
during the Fall 2018 semester at William & Mary.
PyTorch was used for this implementation.
